# Apply Systems Iceberg

Move analysis from visible events down through patterns and structures to the mental models that sustain them — then intervene at the right level.

## Why This Is Best Practice

**Adopted by:** Shell (scenario planning — credited with anticipating the 1970s oil
price shocks, cited in Harvard Business Review as a landmark strategic foresight case),
Unilever, P&G, Ford, and hundreds of Fortune 500 organizational learning programs.
Adopted by WHO, UNICEF, and World Bank for health and development system diagnostics.
MIT Sloan School of Management teaches it as core organizational learning methodology.
**Impact:** Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline" (1990) sold 2M+ copies and was named
one of the most influential management books of the 20th century by HBR. Teams applying
systems thinking identify structural causes of recurring problems — fixing the structure
eliminates recurrence, while event-level fixes produce the same problem again within
months. Shell's use is the most-cited example of strategic foresight in modern business.
**Why best:** Most organizational problem-solving operates at the event level — something
goes wrong, someone fixes it. The same problem returns. The Iceberg Model makes visible
the three hidden levels driving every event: patterns of behavior over time, the
structures generating those patterns, and the mental models that make those structures
seem natural or inevitable. Intervening at the structure or mental model level produces
durable change; intervening at the event level produces whack-a-mole.

## The Four Levels

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  ← waterline
         EVENTS
  "What just happened?"
  [visible, reactive]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
         PATTERNS & TRENDS
  "Has this happened before?"
  [requires data over time]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
         SYSTEMIC STRUCTURES
  "What is causing the pattern?"
  [relationships, incentives, feedback loops]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
         MENTAL MODELS
  "What assumptions make this structure seem normal?"
  [beliefs, values, worldviews — hardest to change]

```

**Leverage:** Events = lowest leverage, highest visibility. Mental models = highest leverage, lowest visibility.

## Steps

### 1. Name the event

State the specific observable event that triggered concern. Be precise — vague events produce vague analysis.

```
Bad:  "Our team has communication problems."
Good: "Three features shipped in Q3 had integration bugs discovered post-launch
       that were not caught in review."
```

### 2. Map the pattern

Collect data over time. Ask: has this happened before? How often? Is it getting better or worse?

- Pull the last 6–12 months of data on this event type
- Sketch a behavior-over-time graph (even rough) — rising, cycling, declining?
- Identify: is this a one-off or a recurring pattern?

If it's a one-off, the Iceberg may be unnecessary — treat the event directly.
If it's recurring, proceed to Level 3.

### 3. Identify the systemic structure

Ask: what relationships, incentives, policies, or feedback loops produce this pattern?

Probe with these questions:
- Who benefits from the current situation? Who is harmed?
- What incentives push people toward the behavior that creates this pattern?
- What feedback is delayed, missing, or distorted? (Delayed feedback is the most common structural cause of oscillating patterns)
- Are there reinforcing loops accelerating the problem? Balancing loops resisting change?
- What constraints or resources are being depleted?

Document the structure as a causal loop diagram if the system is complex:
```
[Deadline pressure] → [skip review] → [integration bugs] → [more firefighting] → [less time for process] → [more deadline pressure]
```

### 4. Surface the mental models

Ask: what beliefs, assumptions, or values make this structure seem acceptable or inevitable to the people in it?

- "We have to move fast — review slows us down."
- "Bugs are normal; we fix them in production."
- "Adding process means losing agility."

These are not character flaws — they are the operating assumptions of the system. They are also where the deepest leverage lives.

Techniques to surface mental models:
- Ask "why is this the normal way to do it?" until you hit a belief, not a fact
- Notice what is never questioned in team retrospectives
- Ask: "What would have to be true for this structure to make sense?"

### 5. Choose the intervention level

| Level | Intervention type | Durability | Speed |
|-------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Event | React, fix the symptom | Days | Fast |
| Pattern | Adaptive response, track trends | Weeks | Moderate |
| Structure | Redesign incentives, feedback, constraints | Months | Slow |
| Mental model | Shift beliefs, reframe assumptions | Years | Very slow |

**Default to structure-level interventions** — they are durable without requiring years of culture change. Mental model change is highest leverage but often infeasible in short timeframes; design structures that work with existing mental models instead.

### 6. Design and test the intervention

For structure-level interventions:
- Change the feedback loop (close delay, add missing signal, correct distorted incentive)
- Redesign the constraint (resource, policy, process)
- Add or remove a reinforcing/balancing loop

Before full rollout, test with a small pilot and watch for unintended consequences — systems often compensate in unexpected ways.

## Rules

- **Don't skip levels.** Jumping from event to mental model without mapping the structure produces philosophical discussion, not action. Jumping from event to structure without mapping the pattern produces structural fixes for one-off events.
- **Data before pattern.** A pattern claimed without data is a story. Behavior-over-time graphs turn stories into evidence.
- **Structures, not people.** The goal is to find the structural cause, not to identify who is at fault. The same person in a different structure usually behaves differently.
- **One iceberg per event.** Don't conflate two recurring events into one analysis — they may have different structures.

## Common Mistakes

**Staying at the event level.** "We fixed the bug. Done." The structure that produced the bug is still running. Next sprint, a different bug.

**Confusing pattern with structure.** "We always have integration bugs in Q3" is a pattern. The structure is: no integration environment exists until Q3 feature freeze, so bugs are only discoverable then. These are different levels — one describes, the other explains.

**Mental model interventions without structural support.** "We need a culture of quality" (mental model) without changing review incentives (structure) produces posters, not change.

**Causal loop diagrams as the deliverable.** The diagram is a thinking tool, not the output. The output is the identified intervention point and the intervention design.

## When NOT to Use

- **True one-off events** with no recurrence — treat the event directly, don't over-engineer
- **Crisis requiring immediate action** — stabilize the event first, apply the Iceberg in the retrospective
- **Problems with an obvious structural cause** — if everyone already knows the structure, skip the diagnosis and go straight to redesigning it
- **Individual performance issues** — systems thinking addresses structural causes; individual coaching addresses individual causes; don't conflate them
