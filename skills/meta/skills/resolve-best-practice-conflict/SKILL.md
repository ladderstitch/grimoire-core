# Resolve Best Practice Conflict

When two active skills disagree, record which wins — once — so the same conflict never surfaces again.

## Why This Is Best Practice

**Adopted by:** Every major developer tool that supports multiple rule sources implements an explicit precedence model: ESLint (config cascade with override), VS Code (workspace → user → default settings), Git (repo → global → system config), TypeScript (tsconfig extends). Conflict-without-precedence is universally rejected at scale because it forces the same decision repeatedly.
**Impact:** Without explicit priority, users re-resolve the same skill conflict every session. The XDG Base Directory Specification (freedesktop.org) documents that absent a resolution order, tools produce inconsistent behavior across invocations — the primary cause of "why did it do that?" confusion in multi-config environments. RFC 2119 precedence modeling (IETF) is the canonical pattern for deterministic rule application in multi-source systems.
**Why best:** The alternative — applying whichever skill the AI happens to retrieve first — produces non-deterministic behavior. Explicit user-defined priority is deterministic, auditable, and revocable. Context qualifiers narrow precedence to the exact situations where the user actually wants it, avoiding over-application of a blanket rule.

## Steps

### Step 1: Identify the conflict

**Mode A — explicit:** User names two skills that conflict (e.g., "SOLID and KISS both apply here — which wins?").

**Mode B — proactive scan:** User asks to scan their preferences file for conflicts, OR you are about to apply two skills and notice they give contradictory guidance.

**Mode B trigger:** This skill also applies when a user observes two practices being applied inconsistently in a project (e.g., 'sometimes we use X, sometimes Y'). The conflict need not be explicitly stated — if the user describes inconsistency or asks 'should we use X or Y?', treat it as a conflict to resolve.

For Mode B, load the active settings files and merge in resolution order:

```
<project>/grimoire.toml   (local — committed, --local)
  > ~/.config/grimoire/grimoire.toml (global — per-user, --global)
    > /etc/grimoire/grimoire.toml    (system — machine-wide, --system)
```

Within any file, cascade by specificity: `[standards.domain.subdomain] > [standards.domain]`

Merge from least to most specific — a subdomain section overrides its parent domain section for the same key within one file. `[standards.engineering.architecture]` overrides `[standards.engineering]`. Across files, the separate file-level hierarchy applies: session > project (`grimoire.toml`) > global (`~/.config/grimoire/grimoire.toml`) > system (`/etc/grimoire/grimoire.toml`).

Before scanning each domain:
- **Resolve active profile** — if user has activated a named profile for this domain, load `[standards.domain.subdomain.profiles.name]` instead of the untagged `[standards.domain.subdomain]` default
- **Check `lock:`** — if set, ignore the less-specific parent domain section for this subdomain; it's self-contained
- **Check `remind:`** — if today ≥ remind date, say "Reminder: review [domain] preferences (set on [date])." Don't block; continue scanning.
- **Check `expires:`** — if today ≥ expires date, warn: "Preferences for [domain] expired on [date] — review before scanning?"
- **Check `skip-if:`** — if current file/context matches any skip-if pattern, skip this domain entirely; don't scan or apply
- **Skip `disabled:` skills** — don't load or analyze them; they're intentionally off
- **Flag `require:` contradictions** — if a skill appears in both `require:` and `disabled:`, flag as contradiction before continuing

**Contradiction rubric:** Two practices are in conflict (not complementary) when applying both simultaneously would require contradictory actions:
- Same trigger, opposite prescriptions (e.g., 'always add types' vs 'prefer implicit types for brevity')
- Mutually exclusive architectural decisions (e.g., 'prefer composition' vs 'prefer inheritance for domain hierarchy')
- Contradictory tool or process requirements for the same step

**Complementary, not conflicting:** practices that apply to different parts of the same domain (e.g., 'write unit tests' + 'write integration tests') or at different lifecycle stages. Do not raise as a conflict.

For each domain (non-disabled skills), compare the "Steps" and "When NOT to Use" sections of co-listed skills. Flag pairs where one skill says "always do X" and another says "avoid X" or "do Y instead." Remember: all listed skills apply — only direct contradictions need resolution.

---

### Step 2: Show the conflict

Load both SKILL.md files. Summarize the specific contradiction in one line each:

```
Conflict: engineering/architecture

  apply-solid-principles  → "Each class should have one responsibility; split
                             classes that do more than one thing."
  apply-kiss-principle    → "Don't split a function when it's still explainable
                             in one sentence — splitting adds indirection."

These conflict when deciding whether to extract a single-responsibility class
that is currently simple.
```

If multiple conflicts found in Mode B, present all at once, then resolve in sequence.

---

### Step 3: Show current priorities (if any)

If the relevant domain section already exists in `grimoire.toml`, display it:

```
Current priorities for engineering/architecture:
  1. Google's engineering practices
  2. SOLID principles
  (no fallback set — default: higher-ranked skill governs silently)
```

If no priorities exist yet for that domain, say so.

---

### Step 4: Ask which wins

If existing priority already found in Step 3, use it silently — skip this step.

If user hasn't already stated a preference:

```
Which should take priority?
  [1] apply-solid-principles — when?  (all contexts / specific context)
  [2] apply-kiss-principle   — when?  (all contexts / specific context)
  [3] Both apply — I want the AI to note the tension and apply both
  [4] Ask me each time

You can narrow either choice to a context (e.g., "SOLID for production code, KISS for scripts").
```

If user already stated a preference earlier in the conversation, use it directly — don't re-ask.

---

### Step 5: Update grimoire.toml

**Duplicate-write check:** Before writing the resolution, check if the exact same domain+practice pair already has a pinned preference. If yes, show the existing pin and confirm: 'This conflict was already resolved: [existing-pin]. Overwrite with new decision? [y/n]'. Do not silently re-pin.

Write the priority using grimoire config set, or directly into the correct domain section. Default to --local (`grimoire.toml`). Ask if user wants --global (`~/.config/grimoire/grimoire.toml`) instead.

```toml
[standards.engineering.architecture]
practices = [
  "SOLID principles: production code",  # index 0 = higher priority; context qualifier after ':'
  "KISS: prototypes, scripts"           # index 1 = lower priority
]
fallback = "ask"                        # optional; only needed if user chose [4]
```

Rules:
- **All listed skills apply.** Array index = priority for resolving direct contradictions. When two skills conflict on a specific point, lower-index skill wins. Non-conflicting guidance from all skills applies regardless of index.
- Context qualifier as `: qualifier` suffix in the practices string. Omit for all-context preference.
- `fallback = "ask"` — AI prompts when skills directly contradict and no priority is set.
- `fallback = "both"` — AI applies both and surfaces the tension.
- Omit `fallback` for default (lower-index skill wins conflict silently).
- `disabled` — array of skill names the AI must never apply in this domain even if installed.
- `ask-before` — array of skill names AI must confirm before applying. Use for high-stakes skills (security, DB migrations, destructive operations).
- `expires` — ISO date string. After this date AI warns before applying. Use for temporary overrides.
- `remind` — ISO date string. Soft nudge on/after date; doesn't block.
- `shared = true` — commit `grimoire.toml` to repo as team standard.
- `lock = true` — the less-specific parent domain section does not contribute to this section.
- `note` — string. AI reads when applying domain skills. Cite when user asks why.
- `require` — array. Skills that MUST apply unconditionally. Win over all conflict resolution. Flag if a skill appears in both `require` and `disabled` — contradiction.
- `author` — string. Who set this preference. Cite when user asks "why do we prefer X?" Include in Step 6 if present.
- `skip-if` — array of file/context patterns. Skip entire domain when matched.
- `[standards.domain.subdomain.profiles.name]` — named profile variant. Inactive until user activates. On activation replaces the untagged default for that domain. Ask whether to create as default or named profile when writing.
- If the domain section already exists, merge conflicting skills into `practices` at the correct index — don't replace other keys.

---

### Step 6: Confirm

Show the updated domain section and the file path:

```
Updated: grimoire.toml

[standards.engineering.architecture]
practices = [
  "SOLID principles: production code",
  "KISS: prototypes, scripts"
]
fallback = "ask"

Next time both skills apply, SOLID governs in production contexts.
KISS governs in prototype/script contexts. Tied contexts → I'll ask.
```

If any optional keys were written, confirm them explicitly:

```
Also recorded:
  require: apply-input-validation     → always applied, unconditional
  ask-before: apply-solid-principles  → I'll confirm before applying SOLID
  skip-if: test files                 → skipping this domain for test files
  author: @backend-team               → attributed to @backend-team
  expires: 2026-09-01                 → preferences expire on 2026-09-01
  remind: 2026-07-01                  → review reminder set for 2026-07-01
  lock: true                          → less-specific sections won't contribute
  note: legacy codebase — avoid new OOP patterns
```

### Proactive scan summary (Mode B)

After scanning and resolving all conflicts:

```
Scanned 12 skills across 4 domains. Found 3 conflicts:

  ✅ engineering/architecture  → SOLID > KISS (resolved above)
  ✅ engineering/testing       → TDD > test-after (resolved above)
  ⚠️  engineering/development  → YAGNI vs DRY — 1 conflict found, skipped (add to queue?)

Updated: grimoire.toml
```

## When NOT to Use

- **Same-domain, non-conflicting skills**: SOLID and Law of Demeter are complementary, not conflicting. Don't rank them unless an actual contradiction arises.
- **Skills in different domains**: KISS (engineering) and KISS-equivalent (writing/simplicity) operate independently — no cross-domain resolution needed.
- **Only one skill applies**: if context clearly selects one skill over the other without conflict, apply it directly.

## Common Mistakes

**Over-resolving**: not every pair of skills that sounds related actually conflicts. Load the SKILL.md files and identify a specific contradiction before treating it as a conflict.

**Global-scoping everything**: default to project-level resolution (`grimoire.toml`). Only write to `~/.config/grimoire/grimoire.toml` when the user explicitly wants the preference across all projects.

**Forgetting context qualifiers**: "SOLID wins" as a blanket rule overrides KISS even in script/prototype contexts where KISS would be correct. Always ask whether the priority is conditional.
